Problems:
0. There are no any name which represent the app.
1. UX: When refresh page, the text input was not focused. If we improve it, the user will add new task quickly and not spend time focusing the text-input manually.
2. When user press ENTER to submit a new task, from the second time, data is duplicated.
3. When user submit a new task succesfully, we should clear the input on the form.
4. We can not remove a task individually by button X.
5. The select all check box sometimes works incorrectly.
6. Button ALL, ACTIVE, COMPLETED are working incorrectly. They seem like being used for filtering above "tasks".
7. The checkbox of individual tasks will throw some errors when checking.
