A. Problems in user interface:
    0. There are no any name which represent the app.
        => 
    1. UX: When refresh page, the text input was not focused, the list of task is not retrieved. 
        => If we improve it, the user will add new task quickly and not spend time focusing the text-input manually.
        => Save data as a key in LocalStorage.
    2. When user press ENTER to submit a new task, from the second time, data is duplicated.
        => resolved
    3. When user submit a new task succesfully, we should clear the input.
        =>
    4. We can not remove a task individually by button X.
        =>
    5. The select all check box sometimes works incorrectly.
        =>
    6. Button ALL, ACTIVE, COMPLETED are working incorrectly. They seem like being used for filtering above "tasks".
        => resolved
        => Alternative: ALL, ACTIVE, COMPLETED => CheckBox: It help user knows current state of list tasks are ACTIVE or COMPLETED.
    7. The checkbox of individual tasks will throw some errors when checking.
        =>
    8. If user create too many task, the layout will over screen.
        =>
B. Problems in source code:
    0. Something went wrong in step of implementation of reducers [reducer.ts].
        - DO NOT change State directly.
        - This is the reason of A2.
